    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p class="lead">Download the Complete Site Rules Here: <a href="https://www.austinymca.org/sites/default/files/branch-files/NACG_Site%20Rules_03.03.14.pdf">Site Rules PDF</a></p>
      <h2>I. Plots</h2>
      <p class="lead">A small individual plot measures 4’x10’, a large individual plot measures 4’x20’, and a community plot measures 8’x20’. The location of a member’s plot is specified in the garden membership contract and on the site map.</p>
      <h3>A. GARDEN MEMBERSHIP FEES</h3>
      <p class="lead">Membership in the garden is defined in the Commission Documents.
All individual plots and community plots will be rented for the time period of one year. The year begins on the first of February.
</br></br>The ADA accessible plots are reserved for garden members who require them to participate in gardening activities. The 5 low-mobility, 24” high ADA accessible plots are available to able-bodied gardeners on half year, or “Seasonal” contracts only in the event that a plot/plots are not reserved by the last day of the contract year or season, and there are no individual plots available. Seasonal contracts run from the February 1 to the July 31, and from August 1 to the January 31.
</br></br>Renewal fees are to be paid by the beginning of each year. Renewal fees not paid on the due date (last day of current membership) may result in the forfeiture of the plot.</p>
      <h3>C. SERVICE HOURS</h3>
      <p class="lead">A cumulative total of one hour per month that the membership contract is active.
</br></br>It is the responsibility of the garden member to record service hours in the NACG binder located at the North Austin YMCA’s Welcome Center.
</br></br>Service hours are not transferrable.
</br></br>There will be designated service hours and duties as determined by the Garden Leadership Group. Garden members can participate in designated service hours, or garden members can contact a member of the Garden Leadership Group to determine a suitable project or job for service hours, or can count any work done during a volunteer day or through a volunteer call. Not all service hours include physical labor. Contact a member of the Garden Leadership Group to learn about these opportunities.</p>
      <h3>D. ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP MEETING</h3>
      <p class="lead">Garden Leadership Group members will be voted in at the Annual Membership Meeting.
	All garden members in good standing are invited to the Annual Membership Meeting and will be given at least 30 days’ notice prior to the event.</p>
      <h3>E. RULES</h3>
      <p class="lead">1. No trees, large cacti or illegal plants may be planted.</p>
      <p class="lead">2. Smoking is strictly prohibited according to the city of Austin's Smoking in Public Places Ordinance (SIPPO) no. 050303-05.
Chewing tobacco is also strictly prohibited. Tobacco carries the mosaic virus, which is deadly to some plants.
</p>
      <p class="lead">
3. No permanent structures should be placed on the plot. Temporary structures should not shade a neighbor’s plot without the approval of that neighbor.</p>
      <p class="lead">4. Only organic nutrients and pest controls are to be used in the garden. No chemical treatments of herbicides, pesticides, or fungicides, and no synthetic fertilizers are allowed. When in doubt about a product or method, check with an Garden Leadership Group member.</p>
      <p class="lead">5. Basic gardening tools will be provided. Gardeners are responsible for any additional tools or equipment they bring. If any of the community tools or other equipment is damaged, please report the damage immediately in the NACG garden binder located at the Welcome Center in the North Austin YMCA.</p>
      <p class="lead">
6. The use of chemically treated wood (i.e. wolmanized wood) and/or CCA pressure treated wood is not prohibited. These products contain arsenic,
hexavalent chromium and other toxic substances, which may leach into the soil.</p>
      <p class="lead">
7. Tools and wheelbarrows should be used only for the purpose for which they were intended and should be returned clean to their proper place in the tool shed. Only gardeners over 18 years of age are allowed to use power- tools. Gardeners should use equipment in a responsible manner and report any mechanical problems.</p>
      <p class="lead">8. Unattended watering is not allowed with the exception of soaker hoses. Soaker hoses may be left on unattended for no more than 3 hours during the daylight hours only. Any soaker hoses left unattended should be run at low pressure. Gardeners using soaker hoses must remain on the North Austin YMCA’s premises while watering and keep water from running off their plot.
Irrigation systems must be maintained and in good repair. Gardeners using sprinklers or hoses should take into account wind and temperatures to ensure as little waste as possible.
No water timers or sprinkler systems are allowed.
Please be considerate of other gardeners and limit watering times when others are waiting and do not drag hoses through other plots.</p>
      <p class="lead">
9. Pets are not allowed on the garden premises with the exception of service animals.</p>
      <p class="lead">
10. Each gardener is responsible for disposal of trash. Do not place any trash in common areas, roadways, or in your plots. Only organic, compostable material is to be placed in the composting area. No trash from off the property may be placed in the trash receptacles.</p>
      <p class="lead">11. No alcohol, illegal substances, or glass containers are allowed on the property.
</p>
      <p class="lead">12. No gardener may sell any produce or flowers that they produced in the North Austin Community Garden in any venue.</p>

</p>
      <p class="lead">14. Gardeners should not dig trenches around the perimeter of their plots, and should not extend their garden dimensions.</p>
      <p class="lead">15. To build and maintain healthy soil structure, gardeners will use
compost, organic fertilizers, mulch and a rotation of plant varieties. Three inches of compost shall be maintained to prevent soil loss and compaction.
</p>
      <p class="lead">
16. All piles of mulch, soil, and compost will be contained to prevent runoff and sedimentation.</p>
      <p class="lead">17. No harassment, threats, verbal abuse, or acts of violence will be tolerated by any person against any other person. Such acts should be reported to the Garden Leadership Group, and if necessary, proper authorities will be called. Any person committing such acts may be asked to forfeit his/her gardening plot, may lose their membership rights (as outlined in the Commission Documents), and/or may lose the privilege of future membership.</p>
